powerpc-ibm-utils (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #436937)
    + Write and add a manpage for the ppc64_cpu utility.
    + Update long description in debian/control to include the
      ppc64_cpu utility.
  * These utilities are not really tied to a specific bootloader,
    such as yaboot, because grub2 makes use of ofpathname. Therefore,
    instead of the Yaboot Maintainers Team, set the maintainer to me.
  * Switch from dpatch to quilt.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Add the Homepage field and remove it from the long description.
  * Add the Vcs-Git/Vcs-Browser fields.
  * Add the DM-Upload-Allowed field.
  * Fix lintian warning "debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
    line 44".
  * Remove unused configure target in debian/rules.
  * Remove the lsprop utility which is already in the powerpc-utils
    package.
